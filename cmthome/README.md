The `cmthome` folder manages your access to the BOSS install on [`lxslc`](https://besiii.gitbook.io/boss/tutorials/getting-started/server) and is essentially a copy of `/afs/ihep.ac.cn/bes3/offline/Boss/cmthome/cmthome-$BOSSVERSION/` (see [Set up your BOSS environment](https://app.gitbook.com/@besiii/s/boss/tutorials/getting-started/setup)). The folder should be located next to your [`workarea`](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_StarterKit/tree/master/workarea).

Note that files such as [`cmthome/setup.sh`](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_StarterKit/blob/master/cmthome/setup.sh) use `bash` variables such as `$BOSSINSTALL`, which need to be set before sourcing them. This is done using by sourcing [`setup/LoadBoss.sh`](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_StarterKit/blob/master/setup/LoadBoss.sh), where `BOSSINSTALL` is determined automatically. CMT will update the paths in the files under `cmthome` accordingly, but these changes should be shielded from being commited to this repository using `git update-index --assume-unchanged cmthome/*`, because we want the Starter Kit to be general in usage.
